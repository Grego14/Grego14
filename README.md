# About me üéÖ‚Äçüíª

Front-end developer with multiple projects, from simple static pages to
dynamically created pages using web technologies such as **ReactJS** and **APIs**

üëâ I'm focusing more on improving my skills in **React** and learning **DSA**

Sometimes I spend hours on [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/gre208981)!

## Latests projects:

[Product list with cart](https://product-cart-with-list.netlify.app/) | [Repo](https://github.com/Grego14/FrontendMentor_Challenges/tree/main/challenges/product-list-with-cart-main)
Build using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **JSX**, **React**, **Motion**, **Vite** and **Biome**.

### The challenge focused on basic things:

**1**.  Allowing the user to add and remove products from the cart.

**2**.  Increasing and decreasing the number of products in the cart.

**3**.  Displaying a confirmation modal when the user clicks the Confirm Order button

**4**.  Restarting selections when the user clicks the Start New Order button

**5**.  Display the optimal layout depending on the user's device

**6**.  Show hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### And I added a few more things to it:

**1**.  **Dark Mode/Theme** Using LocalStorage and CSS Classes.

**2**.  **Discount code** that is only seen when a product is added.

**3**.  Use LocalStorage to **save products stored** by the user in a previous session 
    and in case of a page reload they persist.

**4**.  An element that shows the **number of products and the total price** at the bottom 
    of the device and moves to the top when the user scrolls to the bottom of the 
    page, thus allowing them to correctly see the cart **(Mobile devices only)**. 
    This was possible using the [IntersectionObserver API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/IntersectionObserver).

**5**.  Use of LocalStorage to save data that will be used to **simulate a maximum 
    quantity of a product** and thus prevent products from being added infinitely.

**6**. A component to sort the products in the cart.

The performance of the page was terrible and i was able to improve it using 
techniques such as **dynamic import**, **lazy loading** and reducing the size of the 
images using a tool called **cwebp** to change the format of the images and their size. 
It went from 72 points to **91** in **performance** using those techniques.
